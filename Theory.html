<h2><i>  INTRODUCTION..</i></h2>
<p align="justify">The mounting operation accomplishes three main functions;</p>
<ol>
    <li>  *It protects the specimen edge and maintains the integrity of a materials surface
features</li>
   <li> *It fills voids in porous materials</li>
   <li> *Improves handling of irregular shaped samples, especially for automated specimen
preparation.</li>
</ol>  
<h2> <i>Methods of mounting for various specimen :</i></h2>
<p>The two main techniques used are<b> hot compression mounting</b> and <b>cold mounting</b></p>
<p align="justify">Depending upon the type of specimen and the number of samples required we can use different types of mounting. <b>Cold mounting</b> is used for specimens that
may be damaged by heat or pressure.<b>Hot mounting</b>is normally quicker and economical.</p>
<h2><i>HOT MOUNTING :</i></h2>
<P align="justify">Hot mounting requires a mounting press that combines pressure with a high temperature.  The resulting mounts will be of high quality, uniform size and shape,
and require a short process time.</P>

<p align="center"><b>Hot mounting - process clips</b> </p>
<p>Small, thin specimens can be supported during the hot mounting process by the use of metal fixation clips.</p>
<p align="justify">Two types of hot mounting resins are used in hot mounting process they are :</p>
<p align="center"> a)THERMOSETTING RESINS </p>
<P align="center"> b)THERMOPLASTIC RESIN </P>
<p align="justify"><b>Thermosetting resins</b> cure at elevated temperatures. To avoid porous, non-uniform mounts, it is important that the pressure is always constant and 
at the right level. Once the mount is cured, the only way to remove the specimen is to destroy the mount.</p>
<p align="justify"><b>Thermoplastic resins</b> soften or melt at elevated temperatures and harden during cooling. This resin type can be used to mount pressure-sensitive
specimens. The mounting medium is first heated and then exposed to force when it is soft. This ensures that the mounting medium is pressed into open pores and cracks.
Thermoplastic mounting media can be melted again.</p>

<h2><i>COLD MOUNTING :</i></h2>
<p align="justify"><b>Cold mounting</b> by vacuum impregnation is used to reinforce and protect materials such as ceramics, plasma sprayed coatings, and specimens for failure
analysis that require special care during preparation.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://www.struers.com/-/media/Struers-media-library/Knowledge/Mounting-Cold/Mounting-process-new-974x1000-px.jpg?h=1000&w=974&

<p align="center"><b>Cold mounting cups</b></p>
<p>Two types of cold mounting resins are available they are:</p>
<p align="center"> a)EPOXY RESINS</p>
<p align="center"> b)ACRYLIC RESINS</p>
<p align="justify"><b>Epoxy resins</b> are suitable for mounting of all types of materials and are especially recommended for vacuum impregnation. Epoxies have the lowest
shrinkage of all cold-mounting resins. The curing time is relatively long, but adhesion to most materials is excellent. They polymerize through a chemical reaction after 
being mixed in the correct proportions. The hardened epoxy is duroplastic, and not affected by moderate heat or chemicals</p>
<p align="justify"><b>Acrylics resins</b> are easy-to-use resins with short curing times, very limited shrinkage, and excellent mounting properties. They are well-suited for
both serial mounting of irregularly shaped specimens and for routine work or single specimens. Acrylics are available with and without a mineral filler. Dye can be used if 
color coding is needed. When mixing acrylic resins, it is recommended to add powder to the liquid (hardener) â€“ this will result in the most uniform resin mixture.</p>
